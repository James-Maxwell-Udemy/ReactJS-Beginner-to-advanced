FAQ 
Q1: How do I download the files? A: If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

Q2: I'm stuck in one of the topics. Where do I get help? A: Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy, along with a screenshot. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

Q5: Videos don't load, can you fix it? A: Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues like this. Please just come back a bit later or contact their support team.

Q6: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it? A: Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to higher resolutions. If that doesn't help, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q7: Are the videos downloadable? A: No! to avoid piracy, I have disabled the download option

Q8: I want to put the project in my portfolio. Is that allowed? A: Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is not allowed is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!

Q9: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How? A: Firstly, I appriciate your enthusiasm. I make important announcements on twitter @devarsenal1, instagram @devarsenal_official, linkedin James Maxwell. So you should definitely follow me wherever possible¬†ü§ù

Q10: How do I get my certificate of completion? A: A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please contact the Udemy support team.

Q11: Do you accept pull requests? A: No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the exact same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
